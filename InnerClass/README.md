## ðŸ’¡ Overview

Java allows the definition of classes within other classes. These are called **inner classes** and they provide better encapsulation and can logically group classes that are only used in one place.

This program explains how to use:
- Member Inner Class
- Static Nested Class

## ðŸ§© Inner Class Types Covered

### 1. Member Inner Class
- A non-static inner class defined inside another class.
- Has access to all members (including private) of the outer class.
- Must be instantiated using the outer class object.

### 2. Static Nested Class
- Declared as static.
- Can be instantiated without creating an object of the outer class.
- Can only access static members of the outer class.
